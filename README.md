Linux Kernel Module for Task Information. (Operating System Concepts, 10th Edition, Chapter 3, Project 2)
<h3>Description</h3>
This is a Linux kernel module that uses the '/proc' file system for diplaying a task's information based on it's process identifier value 'pid'.

The whole project can be broken down into 3 steps:

1. Writing a process identifier to the file '/proc/pid'(Module Instantiation)

2. Writing to the '/proc' file system

3. Reading from the '/proc' file system
